# EmuDeck Wiki

## Information

This repository is for a WIP EmuDeck Wiki using MkDocs: [https://www.mkdocs.org/](https://www.mkdocs.org/)

The theme is mkdocs-material: [https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material)

The EmuDeck Wiki Website: [emudeck.github.io](https://emudeck.github.io/)

This **repository** is not for the EmuDeck application, you can find that here: [https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeck/issues](https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeck/issues). If you are having any issues with the EmuDeck application, emulators or tools, use the EmuDeck Discord for support. If you have any feedback on the EmuDeck application, open an issue on the aforementioned repository. 

## How to Contribute

You can contribute to the EmuDeck Wiki in a couple of ways:

### Option 1: A quick shout-out

Send a quick message on EmuDeck's Discord stating what needs to be edited or added. 

### Option 2: Opening an Issue

You will need to create a GitHub account to open an issue.

Once you have created an account, you can visit this page: https://github.com/EmuDeck/emudeck.github.io/issues and submit an issue. 

### Option 3: Editing the Markdown files

You will need to create a GitHub account to open a Pull Request.

Markdown is a fairly straightforward markup language. If you are not familiar, you can take a quick look at the documents in the `docs` folder. 

Depending on your comfort level with GitHub, you can either use GitHub's web editor to edit any markdown files or you may also choose to clone the repository and edit the markdown files that way. 

To edit markdown files in GitHub's web editor, open a document in the `docs` folder, and click the small pencil icon in the top right. Once you are finished, click `Commit changes..`. GitHub will prompt you to open a Pull Request, which will then be merged once it is reviewed. 

### Option 4: Setting up MkDocs

You may choose to contribute to both the Markdown files and the branch (`gh-pages`) that hosts the website. 

You will need to install the following:

* [https://www.mkdocs.org/](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
* [https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/)

To do so, you will need to clone both the `main` and `gh-pages` branches. Make any changes you would like to the markdown files in the `main` branch. Once you are finished making your changes, you can use `gh-deploy`, which will deploy any of your changes directly to the `gh-pages` branch. 

Once you are satisfied with your changes, you may create a PR here.
