### How to Update Emulators, EmulationStation-DE, or Steam ROM Manager
[Back to the Top](#updating-table-of-contents)

***

#### Flatpaks
[Back to the Top](#updating-table-of-contents)

Some emulators come from the system repository as Flatpaks. Running an "Easy Reset" or "Custom Reset" will **NOT** update Flatpaks.

**To update Flatpaks**: 
* Update through the **Discover store**
* Open the EmuDeck application, open the "Manage Emulators" page, click the "Update your Emulators & Tools" button, and click the "Update Flatpaks" button 


It is recommended you monitor and **use the Discover store** to update any system libraries as well. Not updating these system libraries can cause Flatpak emulators to **stop working.**

***

#### AppImages, Binaries, and Windows Executables
[Back to the Top](#updating-table-of-contents)

Some emulators are packaged as AppImages, Binaries, or Windows executables. You can update or change version for these tools and emulators through the EmuDeck application. Running an "Easy Reset" or "Custom Reset" will fetch you the latest version of these emulators and tools.

**To update tools and emulators packaged as AppImages, Binaries, or Windows executables:**
   * Open the EmuDeck application, open the "Manage Emulators" page, click the "Update your Emulators & Tools" button, and click "Update AppImages and Binaries"
       * This button also **includes** any emulators that are downloaded as **Windows executables** and run through Proton. 
           * At the moment, this includes [**Xenia**](https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeck/wiki/Xenia) and [**Cemu**](https://github.com/dragoonDorise/emuDeck/wiki/cemu)
