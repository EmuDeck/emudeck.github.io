### How to Select A Steam Input Profile
[Back to the Top](#hotkeys-table-of-contents)

#### Preface 

EmuDeck comes with a few Steam Input profiles to make hotkeys easier to use in a few emulators. If an emulator does not have a Steam Input Profile, make sure you're on `Gamepad with Joystick Trackpad`, otherwise some controls may not work.

EmuDeck comes with Steam Input Profiles for the following emulators:

* Cemu
   * The Steam Input Profile is necessary to switch screens
* Citra
   * The Steam Input Profile is necessary to switch screens
* DuckStation
    * **Long Press** to activate hotkeys
* melonDS
    * **Long Press** to activate hotkeys
* mGBA
    * **Long Press** to activate hotkeys
* PPSSPP
* RMG
    * **Long Press** to activate hotkeys


#### Selecting  Steam Input Profiles

In Game Mode, single click the game you would like to change the Steam Input Profile for, and click the `Controller Icon` on the right of the screen. Click the layout (whatever name it is currently set to) at the top, and you will see a drop-down menu. When playing a PSX, PSP, 3DS, or Wii U Game, switch to the respective Steam Input Profile.

For a visual, watch the following GIF (DuckStation is being used as an example):

These hotkeys only work in Game Mode and can be used for any Steam or Non-Steam game. 

Hold the `Steam` button to view the list on your Steam Deck as well.

The `Steam` button in the chart below is interchangeable with the `...` (QAM) button. For example, to "Force Game Shutdown", you can either hold `Steam` and the `B` button or hold `...` and the `B` button.

##### An explanation of the EmulationStation-DE Profile

Some emulators set up by EmuDeck need a unique steam input profile (like Cemu or Citra) since you cannot do combo hotkeys easily. These emulators use a Steam Input profile to bind keyboard keys to buttons on a radial or touch menu.

The EmulationStation-DE combines all of these different profiles into a single menu and allows you to select your emulator profile on the fly. For emulators without a Steam Input profile, use combo hotkeys.

##### How to Use the EmulationStation-DE Profile

The EmulationStation-DE profile will be automatically applied to your EmulationStation-DE shortcut. If you have an older install of EmuDeck, you may need to re-run Steam ROM Manager with the EmulationStation-DE parser toggled to apply this profile.

After the EmulationStation-DE profile is applied, use the left trackpad to pull up the menu and **long-press** an icon to switch into the respective profile. The buttons on the various touch and radial menus use a **long-press** to activate the respective hotkey. 

All of the profiles include a `Return to Main Menu` button allowing you to return to the profile switcher menu.

If you do not see an emulator on the EmulationStation-DE touch menu, it likely uses combo hotkeys. This page covers the combo hotkeys for the various emulators.
