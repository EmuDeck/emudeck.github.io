## Prerequisites

### Windows Apps 
- [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/), EmuDeck works using Steam as his backbone so you need to have Steam installed and running to use EmuDeck.

- 7zip, EmuDeck will install it for you

- GIT, we will also install it for you when you first launch EmuDeck.


### Control configurations
All the emulators are configured so you can use them out of the box. No need to configure anything. If some emulator doesn't work, make sure you are launching your games or Emulators using Steam. EmuDeck needs Steam Input to work seamlessly with any controller you might use.
