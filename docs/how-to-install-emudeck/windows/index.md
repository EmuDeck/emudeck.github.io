    * Installed by EmuDeck on initial launch
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
    * Installed by EmuDeck on initial launch


### Control configurations

Controls are configured by EmuDeck. No need to dive into endless controller menus. 

If an emulator does not work, make sure you are launching your game or emulator through Steam. EmuDeck configurations require Steam Input for your emulator or game to work seamlessly with any controller you might use.
