### How to Select A Steam Input Profile
[Back to the Top](#hotkeys-table-of-contents)

#### Preface 

EmuDeck comes with a few Steam Input profiles to make hotkeys easier to use in a few emulators. If an emulator does not have a Steam Input Profile, make sure you're on `Gamepad with Joystick Trackpad`, otherwise some controls may not work.

#### Selecting  Steam Input Profiles

In Game Mode, single click the game you would like to change the Steam Input Profile for, and click the `Controller Icon` on the right of the screen. Click the layout (whatever name it is currently set to) at the top, and you will see a drop-down menu. 

For a visual, watch the following GIF (DuckStation is being used as an example):

These hotkeys only work in Game Mode and can be used for any Steam or Non-Steam game. 

Hold the `Steam` button to view the list on your Steam Deck as well.

The `Steam` button in the chart below is interchangeable with the `...` (QAM) button. For example, to "Force Game Shutdown", you can either hold `Steam` and the `B` button or hold `...` and the `B` button.

#### Emulator Button Combinations Profile
[Back to the Top](#hotkeys-table-of-contents)

Some of the emulators bundled with EmuDeck do not do not support controller hotkeys naturally. These emulators are Cemu, Citra, melonDS (Standalone), and mGBA (Standalone).

To standardize the hotkeys with the other emulators, these profiles require a Steam Input profile that binds keyboard keys to button chords. These button chords allow you to use controller hotkeys with emulators that do not naturally support them.

Typically, this profile will automatically be applied to your shortcuts for Cemu, Citra, melonDS (Standalone), and mGBA (Standalone). To apply it manually, click the `Game Controller` icon in `Game Mode`, change the template to `EmuDeck - Controller Hotkeys`. 

For the specific button combinations, see the following sections:

* [Cemu](#cemu-wii-u)
* [Citra](#citra-3ds)
* [melonDS (Standalone)](#melonds-nds-standalone)
* [mGBA (Standalone)](#mgba-gb-gbc-and-gba-standalone)


***

#### Emulator Frontends Button Combinations Profile
[Back to the Top](#hotkeys-table-of-contents)

 
The frontends bundled with EmuDeck, ES-DE and Pegasus, come with a Steam Input profile for hotkeys. Typically, this profile will automatically be applied to your shortcuts. To apply it manually, click the `Game Controller` icon in `Game Mode`, change the template to `EmuDeck - Frontend Controller Hotkeys`. 

The `EmuDeck - Frontend Controller Hotkeys` profile comes with two action set layers. The first layer is blank intended for emulators with traditional controller hotkeys. The second layer assigns keyboard keys to button combinations, intended for emulators that do not support controller hotkeys naturally. This layer only covers Cemu, Citra, melonDS (Standalone), and mGBA (Standalone).

For the most part, you will be using the first layer, entitled the "All Hotkeys" layer. However, when you are playing a Cemu, Citra, melonDS (Standalone), or mGBA ROM, hold the `Start` button to switch to the `Cemu, Citra, melonDS (Standalone), and mGBA (Standalone)` layer. 

For the specific button combinations, refer to the various sections on this page depending on which emulator you are using. The hotkeys have been largely standardized and for the most part are identical across emulators. Do note there are still a few exceptions:

* The Flycast (Standalone) emulator 
* RetroArch binds the `Next Save State Slot` and `Previous Save State Slot` to `Start` + `DPad Left` or `DPAd Right` whereas most emulators use `Start` + `R2` or `L2` 


***

#### Emulator Frontends Radial Menu Profile
[Back to the Top](#hotkeys-table-of-contents)

This profile is intended for emulator frontends such as ES-DE and Pegasus. This profile will **not** be applied automatically. To apply it manually, click the `Game Controller` icon in `Game Mode`, change the template to `EmuDeck - Steam Deck Radial Menus`. All emulators installed and configured by EmuDeck are included in this profile. 

You may also use this profile with any ROM shortcut or emulator shortcut added through Steam ROM Manager. This profile will appear in the drop-down list of your profiles for any of your shortcuts added to Steam.

Use the left trackpad to pull up the menu and **short-press** an icon to switch into the respective profile. The buttons on the various touch and radial menus use a **short-press** to activate the respective hotkey. 

A bonus feature of this profile is allowing you to map per-game profiles in emulator frontends such as ES-DE and Pegasus. 

##### How to Map Per-Game Profiles

1. To apply the Steam Input profile, click the `Game Controller` icon in `Game Mode`, change the template to `EmuDeck - Steam Deck Radial Menus`
2. On the `Game Controller` screen, click the `Edit Layout`
3. Press `R1` until you see `Blank Profile #` and select one of the 10 `Blank Profiles`
    * There will be 10 Blank Profile action sets
4. On the `Blank Profile` page you selected, remap your controls
5. (Optional) To rename the blank icon in the radial menu:
    * Click `Virtual Menus` on the left side of the screen in the `Controller Settings` menu 
    * Click the `Pencil` icon to the right of `Blank Profile Selector`
    * On the profile # you selected in 3 and 4, click the `Gear` icon, click `Rename command`, and rename your profile
6. When you are finished, exit out and open the frontend
7. On the left trackpad, select the `Blank Profile Selector` icon and select the matching `Blank Profile` number (or your renamed profile) to the profile you mapped in Step 3
