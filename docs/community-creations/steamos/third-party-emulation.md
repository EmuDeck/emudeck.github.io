# Third Party Emulation: Non-EmuDeck Tools and Resources

Learn how to install various tools and resources related to emulation on your Steam Deck outside of what EmuDeck installs. These tools and resources are either difficult to implement into EmuDeck's installation script directly, require elaborate setup, or may be added to EmuDeck in the future pending time and resources. 

The guides on this page are not officially supported by EmuDeck. Many require some level of comfort in the terminal to successfully install. Regardless of your comfort with the terminal, the guides will cover as much detail as possible to address a wide variety of expertise levels. If you get stuck on a certain part, it is encouraged you Google and troubleshoot. The EmuDeck Discord will not be able to promise support for the guides available on this page.

### How to Set up Distrobox
[Back to the Top](#third-party-emulation-table-of-contents)

Many of the decompilations and reverse engineered PC ports must be compiled. Compiling on the Steam Deck can be a bit tricky. Distrobox is one solution to make compiling these easy to do and any changes made within a Distrobox are retained on SteamOS updates.

This section will go over setting up a Distrobox, which you will utilize throughout this page.

#### Prerequisites: Sudo Password

**Note:** Skip this section if you have already set a sudo password

1. In Desktop Mode, open `Konsole`, type in `passwd`, and press enter
2. You'll be prompted to create a password. Your text will not be visible. After you press enter, you will need to type your password again to confirm
3. Exit out of Konsole


#### How to Install Distrobox

This will require your sudo password for the setup

1. In Desktop Mode, open Konsole and enter the following lines, one at a time
    * `curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/89luca89/distrobox/main/install | sh -s -- --prefix ~/.local`
    * `sudo touch /etc/subuid /etc/subgid`
    * `sudo usermod --add-subuid 100000-165535 --add-subgid 100000-165535 $USER`
2. Download `podman-launcher-amd64` from [https://github.com/89luca89/podman-launcher/releases](https://github.com/89luca89/podman-launcher/releases) to your `/home/deck/Downloads` folder
3. Rename `podman-launcher-amd64` to `podman`
    * Casing and spelling are important
4. Right click `podman`, click `Properties`, click `Permissions`, check `Is executable`
5. Move the `podman` file to `/home/deck/.local/bin/`
    * `~/.local` is an invisible folder by default. In Dolphin (file manager), click the hamburger menu in the top right, click "view hidden files" to see these folders

#### How to Configure bashrc

1. In Desktop Mode, open the `/home/deck` folder
     * You may not see the word `deck` in the file path at the top, this is the `home` folder for the `deck` user
2. Click the hamburger menu in the top right, `â˜°`, click `Show Hidden Files`
3. Right click `.bashrc`, click `Open with Kate` or a file editor of your choice
4. Add these lines to the bottom of the `.bashrc` file

```
# Uncomment the xhost line below if you know that you are using xhost
#xhost +si:localuser:$USER
export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
```

5. Save the `.bashrc` file and exit
6. If you had a terminal open previously (Konsole), close out of it and re-open before proceeding to the next section

#### How to Set Up Distrobox

1. Open Konsole
2. Create an Ubuntu Distrobox: `distrobox create --name ubuntu -i ubuntu:23.04`
    * If you get multiple options after inputting this command, select the `docker.io/library/ubuntu:##.##` image by pressing enter on the respective line
3. To enter the Distrobox, open Konsole and enter: `distrobox enter ubuntu`
    * You will need to enter the Distrobox when compiling the various games on this page. You can identify when you are in a Distrobox by looking at the lefthand side of Konsole. Using the Distrobox created by this guide, it will say `deck@ubuntu` 

***

### Terminal Tips and Tricks

* `cd`
    * Change directories
    * For example, if you are working in a folder in terminal and need to change to a subfolder, enter `cd subfoldername`
        * You can press tab to auto-complete the sub-folder name as well
* `cd ..` or `cd -`
    * Change into the previous directory
* `Tab` button
    * Auto complete file and path names
* `ls` or `ll` 
    * List all of the folders and files in the current directory
* `~` can be used in place of `home`
    * For example, if you have a folder in your `Applications` that you would like to navigate to, you can use `cd ~/Applications` instead of typing `cd /home/deck/Applications`
* `mkdir`
    * Create folders
    * For example: `mkdir foldername`   
* `Ctrl` + `C`
    * Terminate a running process
* `Up` arrow key button
    * Repeat last used command
* `Ctrl` + `L`
    * Clear the screen 
* `Ctrl` + `U`
    * Clear current input
* `Ctrl` + `A`
    * Jump to beginning of the line

### Cannonball - OutRun Engine
[Back to the Top](#third-party-emulation-table-of-contents)
   
#### How to Build Cannonball on the Steam Deck

#### What is this?

`CannonBall is a souped-up game engine for the OutRun arcade game.`

Source: [https://github.com/djyt/cannonball](https://github.com/djyt/cannonball)

#### Installing Prerequisites

1. To do the steps in this section, you will need to have created an Ubuntu Distrobox. If you have not created one already, see [How to Set up Distrobox](#how-to-set-up-distrobox) for instructions
2. Enter the Distrobox by opening Konsole and entering: `distrobox enter ubuntu`
3. Enter the following: 
    * `sudo apt install -y sdl2-dev libboost-dev cmake make`

#### Setting Up Cannonball

**Note:** The following folder locations are recommendations. You may choose a different folder location. 

1. In `/home/deck/Applications`, create a `Distrobox` folder
2. In the `Distrobox` folder, right click anywhere in the folder, click `Open Terminal Here`, enter:
    * `git clone --recursive https://github.com/djyt/cannonball.git`
4. A `cannonball` folder will be created, `
5. You  will add your ROM files will be added after the build is finished

#### Building Cannonball

1. In `/home/deck/Applications/Distrobox/cannonball`, right click anywhere in the folder, click `Open Terminal Here`, enter:
    * `distrobox enter ubuntu`
2. Enter: 
    * `mkdir build`
    * `mkdir roms`
    * `cd build`
    * `cmake --fresh -DTARGET=linux.cmake -DOpenGL_GL_PREFERENCE=GLVND -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Release" -S ../cmake/`
    * `make -j4 VERBOSE=1`
3. Wait for it to finish building

#### Providing ROM Files for Super Cannonball

You must provide particular versions of the OutRun ROM files to run Cannonball. OutRun Revision B Roms need to unpacked into the cannonball/build/roms folder. The [cannonball/roms/roms.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/djyt/cannonball/master/roms/roms.txt) file lists the expected file names to help you check that you have unpacked the correct files. 

The location of suitable files cannot be linked here because they are copyright. When you have a suitable archive unpack it so that the files are directly in cannonball/build/roms and not in any subdirectory.

#### How to Configure Cannonball

See the Cannonball manual: 
`https://github.com/djyt/cannonball/wiki/Cannonball-Manual`

No particular reconfiguration is needed for the Steam Deck. The game will default to 16:9 widescreen, and has no 16:10 mode, so there will be small black bars at the top and bottom of the SteamDeck screen. Options can be changed inside the Cannonball UI.

#### How to Run Cannonball

   * `cd ~/Applications/distrobox/cannonball/build`
   * `./cannonball`
