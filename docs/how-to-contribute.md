### Option 2: Opening an Issue

You will need to create a GitHub account to open an issue.

Once you have created an account, you can visit this page: https://github.com/EmuDeck/emudeck.github.io/issues and submit an issue. 

### Option 3: Editing the Markdown files

You will need to create a GitHub account to open a Pull Request.

Markdown is a fairly straightforward markup language. If you are not familiar, you can take a quick look at the documents in the `docs` folder. 

Depending on your comfort level with GitHub, you can either use GitHub's web editor to edit any markdown files or you may also clone the repository and edit the markdown files that way. 

To edit markdown files in GitHub's web editor, open a document in the `docs` folder, and click the small pencil icon in the top right. Once you are finished, click `Commit changes..`. GitHub will prompt you to open a Pull Request, which will then be merged once it is reviewed. 

Once the PR is merged and reviewed, it will automatically be deployed to the website.
