### Why is EmuDeck not downloading?
[Back to the Top](#frequently-asked-questions-table-of-contents)

Internet issues are an increasingly common issue among Steam Decks, even if your internet works perfectly fine on other devices, or you have the latest and fastest internet. You may notice that EmuDeck isn't installing properly, or is taking a long time time to install. You may notice these same internet issues when you try to browse the internet or download a game and the internet speeds are much slower than you would expect. 

You can fix these issues by adjusting your DNS, in System Settings within Desktop Mode, in `Configure Network Settings`. 

**Note:** If you are noticing unexpected behavior with RetroAchievements causing errant controls or freezing, consider trying the below steps. 

**Here's How:** 

1. Click the bottom left icon in the taskbar (Steam Deck icon), click `Settings` in the list, open `System Settings`.
2. Click `Connections` on the left.
3. On the `IPv4` tab, change the `Method` to `Automatic (Only Addresses)`.
4. In the `DNS Servers` box, enter `1.1.1.1`.
5. Click the `IPv6` tab at the top, change the `Method` to `Disabled`.
6. For good measure, restart your Steam Deck.

**Note:** If the above steps still do not fix the issue for you, you can try switching to a 2.4 GHz WiFi network if your ISP provides you with one.

### Where do I get ROMs?
[Back to the Top](#frequently-asked-questions-table-of-contents)

Legally, ROMs must be obtained from your console. Various emulator websites have guides on how to dump games. Other methods are piracy and cannot be discussed here or on the EmuDeck Discord.

### If I install EmuDeck, will it clutter my Steam library?
[Back to the Top](#frequently-asked-questions-table-of-contents)

No! EmuDeck is a "dumb" script that installs a suite of tools and emulators to your Steam Deck. One tool that EmuDeck installs is "Steam ROM Manager", a tool that allows you to add ROMs as non-Steam game shortcuts to your library. You are not required to use Steam ROM Manager.

EmuDeck also installs ES-DE, a front-end that manages all of your ROMs within a single app. You may choose to use either Steam ROM Manager, ES-DE, both, or neither of them. EmuDeck is simply a script, and how you choose to use its installed suite of tools and emulators is up to you. 

After you have installed EmuDeck, you can use Steam ROM Manager and select which parsers you would like to use. You can use the `ES-DE` parser and the `Emulators` parser to add ES-DE and EmuDeck's installed suite of emulators to your Steam library. Adding emulators to your library allows you to tweak settings directly in Game Mode. Turning on other parsers will add the respective system's ROMs to your library. Learn how to generate and save an app list here: [How to Generate and Save an App List](../../tools/steamos/steam-rom-manager.md#how-to-generate-and-save-an-app-list). 

**Read:** [What does EmuDeck Install?](#what-does-emudeck-install), for a list of the tools and emulators EmuDeck installs.

**Read:** [Steam ROM Manager](../../tools/steamos/steam-rom-manager.md) for more information on Steam ROM Manager.

**Read:** [ES-DE](../../tools/steamos/es-de.md) for more information on ES-DE.

### How do I remotely control my Steam Deck?
[Back to the Top](#frequently-asked-questions-table-of-contents)

#### Method 1: Anydesk 

In desktop mode, click the start menu, open Discover (an included flatpak store), and install Anydesk. On your other device, install Anydesk: [https://anydesk.com/en](https://anydesk.com/en). 

***

#### Method 2: Steam Link

On your other device, install Steam Link: [https://store.steampowered.com/remoteplay#anywhere](https://store.steampowered.com/remoteplay#anywhere). You do not need to install any additional software on your Steam Deck. You should be able to connect as long as Steam is open on the Steam Deck. As a bonus, you should also be able to connect while the Steam Deck is in Game Mode.

**Note:** If you are using Steam ROM Manager, it will close out of Steam and disconnect you from Steam Link. 

***

### How do I transfer my initial install of EmuDeck to my SD Card and Vice Versa?
[Back to the Top](#frequently-asked-questions-table-of-contents)

#### Preface

When you install EmuDeck, EmuDeck prompts for an install location, either the SD Card or the Internal SSD. This install location contains the directory for your ROMs, BIOS, and storage files. Regardless of the location you choose, EmuDeck will install its suite of emulators and tools onto your internal SSD. 

However, you may decide to buy an SD Card and want to move that install location from your internal SSD to your SD card. Or you may want to move all of your files back to the internal SSD. 

**Here's how:**

***

#### Transferring from the Internal SSD to SD Card

_Note: If you haven't already, format your SD card in game mode._

1. Switch to Desktop Mode.
2. Locate the `/home/deck` folder, right click the `Emulation` folder, click cut.
    1. You will not see `deck` in the file path, this folder is the `home` folder for the user, `deck`.
3. Open the SD card, right click, press paste. 
    1. To locate this file path, either: 
    2. Open Dolphin (file manager), click Primary on the left.
    3. Open Dolphin (file manager), click rootfs on the left, follow this path, `/run/media/SDCARDNAME/`
        1. Your SD Card may be named: `mmcblk0p1`
4. Open `EmuDeck` on your desktop. If you don't have this shortcut, you can also re-download it from EmuDeck's website: [http://www.emudeck.com/](http://www.emudeck.com/).

### How do I change the Steam Input Controller Profile?
[Back to the Top](#frequently-asked-questions-table-of-contents)

#### Preface 

EmuDeck comes with a few Steam Input profiles to make hotkeys easier to use in a few emulators. If an emulator does not have a Steam Input Profile, make sure you're on `Gamepad with Joystick Trackpad`, otherwise some controls may not work.

EmuDeck comes with Steam Input Profiles for the following emulators:

* Cemu
    * The Steam Input Profile is necessary to switch screens
* Citra
    * The Steam Input Profile is necessary to switch screens
* DuckStation
* melonDS
* mGBA
* PPSSPP
* RMG

#### Changing Steam Input Profiles

In Game Mode, single click the game you would like to change the Steam Input Profile for, and click the `Controller Icon` on the right of the screen. Click the layout (whatever name it is currently set to) at the top, and you will see a drop-down menu. When playing a PSX, 3DS, or Wii U Game, switch to the respective Steam Input Profile.

For a visual, watch the following GIF (DuckStation is being used as an example):

### How to Verify ROMs
[Back to the Top](#frequently-asked-questions-table-of-contents)

#### How to Verify a ROM Successfully Transferred 

Sometimes, data loss or corruption can occur when you transfer ROMs to your Steam Deck. You can verify that the ROM successfully transferred by checking its MD5 Checksum. An MD5 Checksum is a 32-character hexadecimal number that is computed on a file. If the MD5 checksum on both the file on the Steam Deck and the original PC is an exact match, the file transferred successfully. If they do not match, the file is potentially corrupt. You will need to correct or adjust how you transfer files. 

**Here's How**

**On the Steam Deck**

1. Right click the ROM
2. Click Properties
    1. <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108900299/210105434-0ed44a57-c686-462b-afe9-a5ea52faeab3.png" height="300">
3. Click the Checksums tab
4. Click `Calculate` to the right of `MD5`
    1. Wait, it may take a few moments
    2. <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108900299/210106031-f77bd8ef-c0ab-44df-8603-75a502f81934.png" height="300">

* **Linux (Command-line):** [https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/md5sum.1.html](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/md5sum.1.html)

#### How to Verify a ROM is Valid

For one reason or another, your ROM may be corrupt and may not work properly. One way to confirm that you have a valid ROM is by comparing it to the ROM page on [redump.org](http://redump.org). Redump is an internet community "dedicated to collecting precise and accurate information about every video game ever released". You can validate your ROM by comparing its MD5 Checksum, a 32-character hexadecimal number that is computed on a file, to the MD5 Checksum on [redump.org](http://redump.org). 

**Here's How**

#### How to Find your MD5 Checksum

**Note:** `Vampire Night`, for the Playstation 2 is being used as an example in the below guide. 

1. Right click the ROM
2. Click Properties
      * <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108900299/222926543-2411c324-fd05-43db-91ae-0842bcc7989c.png" height="300">
3. Click the Checksums tab
4. Click `Calculate` to the right of `MD5`
      * Wait, it may take a few moments
      * <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108900299/222926493-df0a8680-ba47-497c-a372-25905943d412.png" height="300">
      * Note down the MD5 Checksum for the next section

#### How to Compare your MD5 Checksum to Redump

1. Open redump.org, and search for your ROM 
     * For example, Vampire Night's page: [http://redump.org/disc/13152/](http://redump.org/disc/13152/)
2. Note down the MD5 Checksum on the redump.org page and compare it to your ROM
     * Using Vampire Night as an example:
         * MD5 Checksum on the ROM: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108900299/222926493-df0a8680-ba47-497c-a372-25905943d412.png" height="300">
         * Redump's MD5 Checksum: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108900299/222926621-b1b64ee7-0ed4-4a37-b22c-109c851bd836.png" height="300">
3. The Vampire Night ISO MD5 Checksum matches to the MD5 Checksum on the redump page, meaning the ROM is valid

### Why is my emulator or game muted?
[Back to the Top](#frequently-asked-questions-table-of-contents)

There is no one known reason why an emulator or ROM (run through an emulator) can accidentally be muted. However, the fix is simple.

**Tutorial**

1. In Desktop Mode, open the emulator
    * Example: If you are playing a PS2 ROM, open PCSX2
2. Either temporarily turn off the `Start in Fullscreen` feature or make sure you have a way to use `Alt` + `Tab`
    * You can bind `Alt` + `Tab` to a back bumper, plug in a keyboard, or use Anydesk to switch out of the emulator
3. Launch a game
4. In the taskbar, press the audio icon, select the `Applications` tab, in the list, you should see your emulator with a muted speaker icon
    * <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108900299/216749000-600e9792-4f15-449f-9eaf-aba6bc0c6465.png" height="300">
5. Click the speaker icon to unmute the emulator
    * Make sure to turn fullscreen back on if you turned it off
6. This fix applies to any game you launch through that emulator

### For systems with multiple emulators, how do I select which emulator to use?
[Back to the Top](#frequently-asked-questions-table-of-contents)

#### Steam ROM Manager

These systems will have multiple parsers, each corresponding to a different emulator or RetroArch core. For example: PSX can be played through DuckStation (Standalone), SwanStation, or Beetle PSX. If you prefer to use DuckStation (Standalone) for PSX, enable the Sony PlayStation - DuckStation parser and make sure the SwanStation and Beetle PSX parsers are disabled

#### ES-DE

These systems will have a set default. However, you can change which emulator or RetroArch core is used:

1. In ES-DE, press the Start button
2. Scroll down and select Other Settings
3. Select Alternative Emulators
4. Scroll down to the system you would like to configure, press B, and select your preferred emulator

### How do I navigate to my SD Card through an emulator's menu?
[Back to the Top](#frequently-asked-questions-table-of-contents)

For some emulators, you may need to navigate to your SD Card to install updates/DLC or locate a file of some sort for the emulator. On Linux, your SD card is a file path, so navigating there through the menu will look different. 

**Using Yuzu as a Reference:**

1. Open Yuzu.
2. Click `Files`, `Install files to NAND`.
3. Click `Computer` on the left.
4. Your SD Card path is `/run/media/mmcblk0p1`.
    1. `mmcblk0p1` is the default name of the SD Card when formatted by the Steam Deck.
5. You will now see your `Emulation` folder and you can proceed to locate your files. 

For some emulators, you may need to click `Other Locations` first before seeing `Computer`.

### Why are my emulators stuttering? How do I improve emulator performance?
[Back to the Top](#frequently-asked-questions-table-of-contents)

There may be a number of reasons for this, but your first debugging tool should be to ensure that both the frame limiter and the refresh rate are off. Consider turning off half rate shading if you had it previously on. Half rate shading may cause visual glitches as well. 

To find these options, press the QAM ("..." button), press the battery icon, press advanced view. 

**Note:** It's a good idea to use per game profiles if you intend on changing any of these settings.

### Does EmuDeck have a game compatibility list?
[Back to the Top](#frequently-asked-questions-table-of-contents)

Yes!

Manacharge, an EmuDeck community member, put together a Google Form and a Google Spreadsheet to keep track of how emulated games run on the Steam Deck.

## Citra and Yuzu FAQ
[Back to the Top](#frequently-asked-questions-table-of-contents)

***

### If I already have Citra or Yuzu installed on my system, will this EmuDeck update remove either emulator?

No, existing installs will not be touched.

***

### I don't have Citra or Yuzu, how do I download them?

Since the original GitHub pages for both Citra and Yuzu have been taken down, there is no longer an official source for either emulator. 

Forked repositories ("copies" in other words) of these repositories have been taken down by Nintendo (primarily forks/"copies" of Yuzu).

Due to take-down concerns, distribution of Citra and Yuzu is a sensitive subject and this wiki nor the EmuDeck Discord will cover how to locate copies of either Citra and Yuzu. 

If you can locate a copy of Citra or Yuzu, you may proceed with the rest of the FAQ to learn how to properly use these copies to get the latest EmuDeck configurations. 

***

### Can I still use Citra or Yuzu through Steam ROM Manager and ES-DE?

For Steam ROM Manager, yes, a parser is included for both emulators. If you are missing these parsers, reset Steam ROM Manager's configurations on the Manage Emulators page in the EmuDeck application.

For ES-DE, Citra will continue to be supported. Yuzu support will be removed in the next update. This means that if you use ES-DE as a front-end for your ROMs, you will no longer be able to use Yuzu to launch Nintendo Switch games. 

However, EmuDeck has pushed a hotfix to add back support for Yuzu. In order to get this hotfix, open the EmuDeck application and say yes to the prompt. If you say no or miss this prompt, you may also apply this hotfix at any time by resetting ES-DE or Yuzu on the "Manage Emulators" page in the EmuDeck application. 

***

### Why does ES-DE default to Ryujinx?

Since EmuDeck can no longer install Yuzu for new users, Ryujinx was set as the default emulator in ES-DE. However, swapping back to Yuzu is fairly easy. Do note, you will need the EmuDeck hotfix in order to continue using Yuzu in ES-DE. If you missed this hotfix, you may apply it at any time by resetting Yuzu on the "Manage Emulators" page in the EmuDeck application. 

To swap back to Yuzu:

1. In ES-DE, press the `Start` button
2. Scroll down and select `Other Settings`
3. Select `Alternative Emulators`
4. Scroll down to `switch`, select `Yuzu (Standalone)`

***

### How do I get the latest EmuDeck launchers and configurations on Linux/SteamOS?

Place `citra-qt.AppImage` and `yuzu.AppImage` directly in `$HOME/Applications` (`/home/deck/Applications` on a Steam Deck). No subfolders. The names are case sensitive. 

After you have placed the AppImages in the appropriate place, you will see a "Reset configuration" button on each emulator page on the Manage Emulators page in the EmuDeck application. Click "Reset configuration" to get the latest launcher and configurations. 

The latest configurations will work with the new Steam Input profiles included in EmuDeck 2.2. See [Emulator Frontends Button Combinations Profile](../../controls-and-hotkeys/steamos/hotkeys.md#emulator-frontends-button-combinations-profile) and [Emulator Frontends Radial Menu Profile](../../controls-and-hotkeys/steamos/hotkeys.md#emulator-frontends-radial-menu-profile) for more information. 

***

### How do I get the latest EmuDeck launchers and configurations on Windows?

The files for both emulators should be located in `%USERPROFILE%\EmuDeck\EmulationStation-DE\emulators\citra` and `%USERPROFILE%\EmuDeck\EmulationStation-DE\emulators\yuzu\yuzu-windows-msvc` respectively.

After you have placed the emulator files in the appropriate place, you will see a "Reset configuration" button on each emulator page on the Manage Emulators page in the EmuDeck application. Click "Reset configuration" to get the latest launcher and configurations. 

***

### Why does the BIOS checker say I have missing firmware?

Now that EmuDeck installs Ryujinx by default and can no longer install Yuzu, the BIOS checker **only** checks for the presence of **both** Ryujinx keys and firmware.

For Ryujinx, **both** keys and firmware are required. If you do not have Ryujinx keys and firmware, the BIOS checker will say these are missing. 

If you only have Yuzu keys (since the BIOS checker only checks for Ryujinx) and do not have Ryujinx configured, the BIOS checker will say these are missing. 

However, the BIOS checker does not correlate to the validity of the keys in Yuzu. If you have the keys in place and you can confirm that these are valid, then Yuzu will work just fine.

### Why is the Steam Input profile not working?

Reset Citra or Yuzu in the EmuDeck application on the "Manage Emulators" page. If the Steam Input profile still does not work, re-select it in the Steam Input list. For instructions, see [How to Select a Steam Input Profile](../../controls-and-hotkeys/steamos/hotkeys.md#how-to-select-a-steam-input-profile).
