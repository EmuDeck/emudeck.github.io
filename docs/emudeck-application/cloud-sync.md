### Getting Started with CloudSync
[Back to the Top](https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeck/wiki/cloud-saves#cloud-saves-table-of-contents)

If you have already installed EmuDeck you'll need to:

- Reset SteamRomManager configuration.
- Parse all your SteamRomManager entries again so they are updated with the new launchers.

Now you can carry on the next step, configure CloudSync.

- A browser window will appear so you can log into your cloud provider. If nothing happens please install Chrome or any Chromium based browser like Brave. Firefox doesn't work.
