## Getting Started with Cloud Services
[Back to the Top](https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeck/wiki/cloud-services#cloud-services-table-of-contents)

1) Launch "Cloud Services Manager" from EmuDeck
2) Verify the correct web browser is set as shown on the main menu
    * If not, click "Change Settings" and select your desired web browser.
    * Note: If the web browser isn't installed, EmuDeck will install it. To uninstall a browser, use the "Discover" app in desktop mode.
3) Return to the main menu and choose "Manage Cloud Services" or "Manage Remote Play Clients"
    - 3.1) "Manage Cloud Services"
        -  3.1.1) Check the boxes for scripts you want or uncheck those you want removed then click "Ok"
        -  3.1.2) Any checked scripts will be downloaded into your "Emulation/roms/cloud" directory and any existing that match our file names will be updated.
    - 3.2) "Manage Remote Play Clients"
        -  3.2.1) Check the boxes for which clients you want then click "Start"
        -  3.2.2) Any unchecked (if previously installed) will be uninstalled.
        -  3.2.3) Any checked will be installed or updated if previously installed
        * Note: You can also uninstall these clients from the "Discover" app in desktop mode since they are flatpaks.
4) After making any changes (installing/uninstalling/file renaming) you need to run Steam Rom Manager (SRM) using the "Cloud Services" or "Remote Play Clients" parser so uninstalled items are removed and newly installed items are added to Steam with artwork and accessible in game mode.

"Cloud Services" will be shown in a new Steam collection labeled "Cloud Services"
"Remote Play Clients" will be shown in a new Steam collection labeled "Remote Play Clients"

\* These may be self hosted services. If you run your own server, open the script in a text editor (KWrite, Notepad, etc) and change the `LINK` variable to be your server IP address. After saving, be sure to rename the file so it isn't reverted to default when you update the scripts. (Example: "Plex.sh" --> "-Plex.sh")
