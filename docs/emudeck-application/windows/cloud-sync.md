### Getting Started with CloudSync
[Back to the Top](https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeckwiki/emudeck-application/windows/cloud-sync#cloud-sync-table-of-contents)

If you have already installed EmuDeck you'll need to:

- Open EmuDeck so your saved folders are modified (we won't delete anything and a backup will be done)
- Reset SteamRomManager configuration.
- Parse all your SteamRomManager entries again so they are updated with the new launchers.

Now you can carry on the next step, configure CloudSync.

### Configuration
[Back to the Top](https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeckwiki/emudeck-application/windows/cloud-sync#cloud-sync-table-of-contents)
 
- Click on the CloudSync link inside of EmuDeck
- Select your provider and click on Install
- A browser window will appear so you can log into your cloud provider. If nothing happens please install Chrome or any Chromium based browser like Brave. Firefox doesn't work.
- You'll be prompted to either download all your saves or upload your saves to the cloud.
- You are done :)
