# EmulationStation-DE Update

EmulationStation-DE just released a major new update, bringing them up to version 3.0. Congratulations to the dev team for their great work!

Check out the full changelog at [https://gitlab.com/es-de/emulationstation-de/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md](https://gitlab.com/es-de/emulationstation-de/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

One major change with the update is that the configuration directory has been changed from `.emulationstation` to `ES-DE`. This change means that in order to start using EmulationStation-DE again, you will have to rename this folder.

For a quick way to do that, open the EmuDeck application, visit the Manage Emulators page, click EmulationStation-DE, click EmulationStation-DE, and click Reset Configuration. This fix only works for SteamOS/Linux users at the moment. A hotfix is on its way for Windows users.

In the meantime, Windows users can simply rename the `.emulationstation` folder to `ES-DE`. This folder can be found in the below path:

`%USERPROFILE%\emudeck\EmulationStation-DE\.emulationstation`

Don't forget to take a moment and read through the changelog to discover all of the new wonderful changes with EmulationStation-DE 3.0.
