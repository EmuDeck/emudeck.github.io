# EmulationStation-DE Update

EmulationStation-DE just released a major new update, bringing them up to version 3.0. Congratulations to the dev team for their great work!

Check out the full changelog at [https://gitlab.com/es-de/emulationstation-de/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md](https://gitlab.com/es-de/emulationstation-de/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

One major change with the update is that the configuration directory has been changed from `.emulationstation` to `ES-DE`. The new folder **no longer** has a dot in front of its name. This change means that in order to start using EmulationStation-DE again, you will have to rename this folder.

**On SteamOS**

For a quick way to rename this folder, open the EmuDeck application, visit the Manage Emulators page, click EmulationStation-DE, and click Reset Configuration. 

If you have a lot of custom settings already enabled, simply rename the `.emulationstation` folder to `ES-DE`. You can find this folder in `$HOME/.emulationstation` (`/home/deck/.emulationstation` on a Steam Deck). Do note that the new folder **no longer** has a dot in front of its name.

In order to see the `.emulationstation` folder, in Dolphin (file manager), click the hamburger menu in the top right, click `Show Hidden Files`.

**On Windows**

For a quick way to rename this folder, open the EmuDeck application and the changes will be automatically applied. 

Don't forget to take a moment and read through the changelog to discover all of the new wonderful changes with EmulationStation-DE 3.0.
